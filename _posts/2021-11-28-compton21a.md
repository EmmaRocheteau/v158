title: 'MEDCOD: A Medically-Accurate, Emotive, Diverse, and Controllable Dialog System'
abstract: We present MEDCOD, a Medically-Accurate, Emotive, Diverse, and Controllable
  Dialog system with a unique approach to the natural language generator module. MEDCOD
  has been developed and evaluated specifically for the history taking task. It integrates
  the advantage of a traditional modular approach to incorporate (medical) domain
  knowledge with modern deep learning techniques to generate flexible, human-like
  natural language expressions. Two key aspects of MEDCODâ€™s natural language output
  are described in detail. First, the generated sentences are emotive and empathetic,
  similar to how a doctor would communicate to the patient.  Second, the generated
  sentence structures and phrasings are varied and diverse while maintaining medical
  consistency with the desired medical concept (provided by the dialogue manager module
  of MEDCOD). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
  creating a human-like medical dialogue system. Relevant code is available at https://github.com/curai/curai-research/tree/main/MEDCOD.
