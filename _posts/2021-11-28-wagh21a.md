title: Domain-guided Self-supervision of EEG Data Improves Downstream Classification
  Performance and Generalizability
abstract: 'This paper presents a domain-guided approach for learning representations
  of scalp-electroencephalograms (EEGs) without relying on expert annotations. Expert
  labeling of EEGs has proven to be an unscalable process with low inter-reviewer
  agreement because of the complex and lengthy nature of EEG recordings. Hence, there
  is a need for machine learning (ML) approaches that can leverage expert domain knowledge
  without incurring the cost of labor-intensive annotations. Self-supervised learning
  (SSL) has shown promise in such settings, although existing SSL efforts on EEG data
  do not fully exploit EEG domain knowledge. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent
  SSL models generalize to unseen tasks and datasets. Here we explore whether SSL
  tasks derived in a domain-guided fashion can learn generalizable EEG representations.
  Our contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose novel SSL tasks for EEG based on
  the spatial similarity of brain activity, underlying behavioral states, and age-related
  differences; 2) we present evidence that an encoder pretrained using the proposed
  SSL tasks shows strong predictive performance on multiple downstream classifications;
  and 3) using two large EEG datasets, we show that our encoder generalizes well to
  multiple EEG datasets during downstream evaluations.'
