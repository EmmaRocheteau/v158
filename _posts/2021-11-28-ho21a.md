title: Prognosticating Colorectal Cancer Recurrence using an Interpretable Deep Multi-view
  Network
abstract: 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most common cancers worldwide,
  and around 30-50% of patients who have undergone curative-intent surgery will eventually
  develop recurrence. Early and accurate detection of cancer recurrence is essential
  to improve the health outcomes of patients. In our study, we propose an explainable
  multi-view deep neural network capable of extracting and integrating features from
  heterogeneous healthcare records. Our model takes in inputs from multiple views
  and comprises: 1) two subnetworks adapted to extract high quality features from
  time-series and tabular data views, and 2) a network that combines the two outputs
  and predicts CRC recurrence. Our model achieves an AUROC score of 0.95, and precision,
  sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.84, 0.82 and 0.96 respectively, outperforming
  all-known published results based on the commonly-used CEA prognostic marker, as
  well as that of most commercially available diagnostic assays. We explain our modelâ€™s
  decision by highlighting important features within both data views that contribute
  to the outcome, using SHAP with a novel workaround that alleviates assumptions on
  feature independence. Through our work, we hope to contribute to the adoption of
  AI in healthcare by creating accurate and interpretable models, leading to better
  post-operative management of CRC patients.'
