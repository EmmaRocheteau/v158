title: Question Answering for Complex Electronic Health Records Database using Unified
  Encoder-Decoder Architecture
abstract: An intelligent machine that can answer human questions based on electronic
  health records (EHR-QA) has a great practical value, such as supporting clinical
  decisions, managing hospital administration, and medical chatbots. Previous table-based
  QA studies focusing on translating natural questions into table queries (NLQ2SQL),
  however, suffer from the unique nature of EHR data due to complex and specialized
  medical terminology, hence increased decoding difficulty. In this paper, we design
  UniQA, a unified encoder-decoder architecture for EHR-QA where natural language
  questions are converted to queries such as SQL or SPARQL. We also propose input
  masking (IM), a simple and effective method to cope with complex medical terms and
  various typos and better learn the SQL/SPARQL syntax. Combining the unified architecture
  with an effective auxiliary training objective, UniQA demonstrated a significant
  performance improvement against the previous state-of-the-art model for MIMICSQL*
  (14.2% gain), the most complex NLQ2SQL dataset in the EHR domain, and its typo-ridden
  versions (Â 28.8%  gain). In addition, we confirmed consistent results for the graph-based
  EHR-QA dataset, MIMICSPARQL*.
