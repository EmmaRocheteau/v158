title: 'Attention Distillation for Detection Transformers: Application to Real-Time
  Video Object Detection in Ultrasound'
abstract: We introduce a method for efficient knowledge distillation of transformer-based
  object detectors. The proposed “attention distillation” makes use of the self-attention
  matrices generated within the layers of the state-of-art detection transformer (DETR)
  model. Localization information from the attention maps of a large teacher network
  are distilled into smaller student networks capable of running at much higher speeds.
  We further investigate distilling spatio-temporal information captured by 3D detection
  transformer networks into 2D object detectors that only process single frames. We
  apply the approach to the clinically important problem of detecting medical instruments
  in real-time from ultrasound video sequences, where inference speed is critical
  on computationally resource-limited hardware. We observe that, via attention distillation,
  student networks are able to approach the detection performance of larger teacher
  networks, while meeting strict computational requirements. Experiments demonstrate
  notable gains in accuracy and speed compared to detection transformer models trained
  without attention distillation.
