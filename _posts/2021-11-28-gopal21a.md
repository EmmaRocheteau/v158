title: '3KG: Contrastive Learning of 12-Lead Electrocardiograms using Physiologically-Inspired
  Augmentations'
abstract: We propose 3KG, a physiologically-inspired contrastive learning approach
  that generates views using 3D augmentations of the 12-lead electrocardiogram. We
  evaluate representation quality by fine-tuning a linear layer for the downstream
  task of 23-class diagnosis on the PhysioNet 2020 challenge training data and find
  that 3KG achieves a 9.1% increase in mean AUC over the best self-supervised baseline
  when trained on 1% of labeled data. Our empirical analysis shows that combining
  spatial and temporal augmentations produces the strongest representations. In addition,
  we investigate the effect of this physiologically-inspired pretraining on downstream
  performance on different disease subgroups and find that 3KG makes the greatest
  gains for conduction and rhythm abnormalities. Our method allows for flexibility
  in incorporating other self-supervised strategies and highlights the potential for
  similar modality-specific augmentations for other biomedical signals.
