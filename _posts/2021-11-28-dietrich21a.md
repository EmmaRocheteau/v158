title: Towards Explainable End-to-End Prostate Cancer Relapse Prediction from H&E
  Images Combining Self-Attention Multiple Instance Learning with a Recurrent Neural
  Network
abstract: Clinical decision support for histopathology image data mainly focuses on
  strongly supervised annotations, which offers intuitive interpretability, but is
  bound by expert performance. Here, we propose an explainable cancer relapse prediction
  network (eCaReNet) and show that end-to-end learning without strong annotations
  offers state-of-the-art performance while interpretability can be included through
  an attention mechanism. On the use case of prostate cancer survival prediction,
  using 14,479 images and only relapse times as annotations, we reach a cumulative
  dynamic AUC of 0.78 on a validation set, being on par with an expert pathologist
  (and an AUC of 0.77 on a separate test set). Our model is well-calibrated and outputs
  survival curves as well as a risk score and group per patient. Making use of the
  attention weights of a multiple instance learning layer, we show that malignant
  patches have a higher influence on the prediction than benign patches, thus offering
  an intuitive interpretation of the prediction. Our code is available at www.github.com/imsb-uke/ecarenet.
